# Statement of Biblical Authority

At the center of Christian faith and practice stands the belief that God has spoken to the world in the person and work of Jesus Christ, which is accurately and authoritatively revealed in the Christian Bible (“the Bible,” “Scripture,” or “the Scriptures”). We believe that the Bible is the word of God, fully inspired and without error in the original manuscripts, written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. The Bible is the inspired, inerrant and sufficient Word of God and is thus the ultimate authority for life, faith, conduct, and morals. Though the various theological statements of the Church reflect succinct summaries of biblical boundaries, it is the Bible itself to which we are in ultimate submission.

### Biblical Interpretation

Members have the responsibility and opportunity to engage the Membership and Church staff on areas of theological disagreement. However, membership carries with it the implicit understanding that the Membership shall function as the interpretive authority on biblical meaning and application for the purpose of Church doctrine, practice, policy and discipline.

# Statement of Beliefs

We affirm the Holy Bible as the inspired Word of God and the basis of our beliefs. We hold to the historic doctrines of the Baptist faith, including the Baptist Faith and Message 2000, which is hereby incorporated by reference, which are briefly summarized and as follows, and the additional beliefs stated within:

### About God and the Trinity

We believe in the one and only true God, Who is spirit, sovereign, personal, infinite and eternal. His is one being of three distinct persons: The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit. We believe that He concerns Himself mercifully in the affairs of men, that He hears and answers prayers, and that He saves from sin and death all who come to Him through Jesus Christ. We believe God is the Creator and Ruler of the world. 

*Genesis 1:1,26,27; Genesis 3:22; Psalm 90:2; Isaiah 45:5-6, Isaiah 46:9-10; Matthew 28:19; John 17:3; II Corinthians 13:14; I Peter 1:2*

### About Man

We believe man was created in the image of God and He created them male and female. In the beginning man was innocent of sin and was endowed by His Creator with freedom of choice. By his free choice man sinned against God and brought sin into the human race. As a result, all human beings are born with a sinful nature. Man is incapable of regaining a right relationship with God through his own efforts. It is only the grace of God that can restore man into His holy fellowship and enable man to fulfill the creative purpose of God. 

*Genesis 1:27; Psalm 8:3-6; Isaiah 53:6a, Isaiah 59:1-2; Jeremiah17:9; Romans 3:23, Romans 5:8,12-25; Ephesians 2:1-3*

### About Jesus Christ

We believe in Jesus Christ, God’s only begotten Son, conceived by the Holy Spirit. We believe in His virgin birth, sinless life, miracles, and teachings. We believe in His substitutionary atoning death, bodily resurrection, ascension into Heaven, perpetual intercession for His people, and personal visible return to earth. We believe Jesus Christ is co-equal with the Father and is both fully God and human. It is only through faith in the person and work of Jesus Christ and repentance from sin can one be restored to God and experience true life and joy. He did all this in order to display His love for mankind and to restore them back into a right relationship with Himself. 

*Matthew 1:22-23; Luke 2:52; Colossians 1:15-20; Hebrews 1:1-3; Isaiah 9:6; John 1:1-15, John 14:10-30; Hebrews 4:14-15; I Corinthians 1:15-20; Romans 1:3-4; Acts 1:9-11; I Timothy 6:14-15; Titus 2:13; John 1:29; John 10:1-18; Romans 5:8; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Galatians 1:4; 1 Peter 3:18; Matthew 28:1-20; Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-53; 1 Corinthians 15:12-34; John 14:3; Acts 1:11; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; Hebrews 9:28; 1 John 3:2; Revelation 1:7; John 3:16,18; Acts 4:12; Romans 3:21-26: I Timothy 2:5-6*

### About the Holy Spirit

We believe the Holy Spirit regenerates those who believe and indwells, baptizes, seals, empowers, guides, teaches and sanctifies all who become children of God through Jesus Christ. We believe in the ministry of all the gifts of the Spirit to be functional and an active part of the Church. We believe the Holy Spirit is co-equal with the Father and the Son of God. Through the proclamation of the Gospel, the Holy Spirit reveals to men their need to repent of their sins and confess Jesus as Lord and Savior. He lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation. He provides the Christian with power for living, understanding of spiritual truth, and guidance in doing what is right. He gives every believer a spiritual gift when they are saved. As Christians, we seek to live under His control daily. 

*John 14:16-17; John 16:7-13; Acts 1:8; 1 Corinthians 2:12, 1 Corinthians 3:16; 2 Corinthians 3:17; Galatians 5:25; Ephesians 1:13, 5:18*

### About the devil

We believe in the existence of Satan who was originally created a holy and perfect being, but through pride and unlawful ambition rebelled against God. He is now the prince of the world and leader of all the other fallen angels and evil spirits. He tempted man in the Garden of Eden and Jesus Christ in the wilderness; accuses the saints, is the father of lies and false religions; that he will be destroyed once and for all at the end of the millennial reign and cast into the fires of hell, which have been reserved for him and his angels. 

*Isaiah 14:12-15; Ezekiel 28:14-17; Revelation 12:9; Jude 6; 2 Peter 2:4; Ephesians 2:2; John 14:30; 1 Thessalonians 3:5; Matthew 4:13; 1 Peter 5:8; 1 John 3:8; Matthew 13:25, 37-39; Luke 22:3-4; Revelation 12:10; 2 Corinthians 11:13-15; Mark 13:21-22; I John 4:3; 1 John 2:22; 2 John 7; Revelation 12:7-9; Revelation 20:1-3, 10; Matthew 25:41; 2 Peter 2:4; Jude 1:6*

### About Salvation and Regeneration

We believe that all men are sinners by nature and by choice and are therefore, under condemnation. We believe that the Holy Spirit regenerates those who repent of their sins and trust in Jesus Christ as Savior. We believe salvation is a free gift from God. We believe that the blood Jesus Christ shed on the Cross provides the sole basis for the forgiveness of sin. God offers salvation to those who put their faith in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Chris as sufficient for the payment for their sin. There is no salvation apart from a personal faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior and for the forgiveness of sin. Eternal life begins the moment someone receives Jesus Christ into his or her life by faith. It is only through faith in the person and work of Jesus Christ and repentance from sin that one can be restored to God and experience true life and joy. 

*John 1:12, John 14:6; Romans 5:1, Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5*

### About Eternal Security

We believe God gives the believer eternal life through Jesus Christ, therefore the believer in Jesus is secure in that salvation for eternity. Salvation is maintained by the grace, mercy, and power of God; not by the self-effort of the believer. It is the grace and power of God that gives this security. 

*John 10:29; 2 Timothy 1:12; Hebrews 7:25; Hebrews 10:10, 14; 1 Peter 1:3-5*

### About the Church

We believe in the universal church, a living spiritual body of which Jesus Christ is the head and all regenerated persons are members. We believe in the local church, consisting of a company of believers in Jesus Christ, baptized on a credible profession of faith and associated for worship, work and fellowship. We believe that God has laid upon the members of the local church the primary task of giving the Gospel of Jesus Christ to a lost world. All members of the Church are to be a vital and committed part of the local church. The Church acknowledges Jesus Christ as her only Head and governs herself by democratic principles under the oversight of her membership. Her two ordinances are Baptism by immersion and the Lord’s Supper. 

*Acts 16:5; 1 Corinthians 4:17; Ephesians 5:23; Colossians 1:18*

### Christian Conduct

We believe that a Christian should live for the glory of God and the wellbeing of his/her fellowman: that he/she should strive to live righteously before the world; that he/she should be a faithful steward of his/her possessions; and that he/she should seek to realize for himself/herself and others the stature of maturity in Jesus Christ.

### Ordinances

We believe that our Lord Jesus Christ has committed to ordinances to the local church: baptism and the Lord’s Supper. We believe that Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water into the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. We believe that Christ instituted the Lord’s Supper for commemoration of His death. We believe that these two ordinances should be observed and practiced by all true Believers, until the return of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

*Matthew 3:16; Matthew 28:19-20; Mark 1:9; Acts 2:41; Acts 8:12-13; Acts 8: 38-39; Romans 6:4; 1 Corinthians 11:23-32; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Colossians 2:12; Matthew 26:26-30; Mark 14:22-26; Luke 22:14-20*

### About the Bible

We believe the Bible is God’s Word to us. The Bible was written under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit by human authors. It is the supreme source of truth for Christian beliefs and living. The Scriptures are true, authoritative and sufficient. 

*Psalm 12:12:6; Psalm 19:7-11; Psalm 119:105; Psalm 138:2; Proverbs 30:5; 2 Timothy 1:13; 1 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21*

### About Religous Liberty and Civil Government

We believe that every human being has direct relations with God, and is responsible to God alone in matters of faith; that the church must be free from interference by any ecclesiastical or political authority; that, therefore, Church and State must be kept separate as having different functions, each fulfilling its duties free from dictation or patronage of the other. We believe that civil government is of divine appointment, for the interests and good order of human society; that magistrates are to be prayed for, conscientiously honored and obeyed; except only in things opposed to the will of our Lord Jesus Christ; who is the Lord of the conscience, and the coming Prince of the Kings of the earth.

*Daniel 3:17-18; Matthew 10:28; Matthew 23:10; Revelation 10:6; Philippians 2:10-11; Psalm 72:11*

### About the Return of Christ

We believe in the second coming of Christ, that His return from Heaven will be personal, visible and glorious, a blessed hope for which we should constantly watch and pray. 

*Matthew 28:6-7; Luke 24:39; John 20:27; 1 Corinthians 15:4; Mark 16:6; Luke 24:2, 4-6; Acts 1:9; Luke 24:51; Mark 16:19; Revelation 3:21; Hebrews 8:1, 6; 1 John 2:1; Hebrews 2:17; Hebrews 5:9-10; John 14:3; Acts 1:11; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; Matthew 24:27, 42; Matthew 25:13; James 5:8; Hebrews 9:28; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17; 1 Corinthians 15:42-44, 51-53; Philippians 3:20-21; Luke 1:32; Isaiah 9:6-7; 1 Corinthians 15:25; Isaiah 11:405; Isaiah 32:1; Psalm 72:8; Revelation 20:1-4, 6; Zechariah 14; Luke 1:32-33; Revelation 3:21; Revelation 19:11-16; Revelation 21:1-6; 2 Peter 3:8-10*

# Statement on Marriage and Sexuality

We believe that the term “marriage” has only one meaning and that is marriage sanctioned by God, which joins one biological, natural-born man and one biological, natural-born woman in a single, exclusive union, as delineated in Scripture. Though various cultures and customs have evolving definitions on marriage, it is God alone who has ultimate authority to prescribe and describe the marital relationship. 

*Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:1-9, Mark 10:1-2*

We believe that God intends sexual intimacy to only occur between a man and a woman who are married to each other. We believe that God has commanded that no intimate sexual activity be engaged in outside of a marriage between a man and a woman.

We believe that any form of sexual immorality, such as adultery, fornication, homosexuality, bisexual conduct, bestiality, incest, pornography or any attempt to change one’s sex, or disagreement with one’s biological, natural-born sex, is sinful and offensive to God. Also, the Church regards as sinful the intent or desire to surgically alter one’s biological, natural-born sex to a different sex. Since the body is a creation of God, the church holds sexual identity to be biologically determined by God at conception, and associated gender norms are to be observed as appropriate to biblical standards. 

*Genesis 1:27; Romans 1:26-32; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11*

So we believe, according to Scripture, that every person must be afforded compassion, love, kindness, respect, and dignity. Hateful and harassing behavior or attitudes directed toward any individual are to be repudiated and are not in accord with Scripture nor the doctrines of the church.

We believe that in order to preserve the function and integrity of the Church as the local Body of Christ, and to provide a biblical role model to the church members and the community, it is imperative that all persons employed by the church in any capacity, or who serve as volunteers, should abide by and agree to the Statement on Marriage and Sexuality and conduct themselves accordingly.
