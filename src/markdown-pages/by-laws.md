## ARTICLE X <br/> STATEMENT OF FAITH AND DOCTRINE

### 10.01 - Statement of Biblical Authority

At the center of Christian faith and practice stands the belief that God has spoken to the world in the person and work of Jesus Christ, which is accurately and authoritatively revealed in the Christian Bible (“the Bible,” “Scripture,” or “the Scriptures”). We believe that the Bible is the word of God, fully inspired and without error in the original manuscripts, written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. The Bible is the inspired, inerrant and sufficient Word of God and is thus the ultimate authority for life, faith, conduct, and morals. Though the various theological statements of the Church reflect succinct summaries of biblical boundaries, it is the Bible itself to which we are in ultimate submission.

#### 10.01.01 - Biblical Interpretation

Members have the responsibility and opportunity to engage the Membership and Church staff on areas of theological disagreement. However, membership carries with it the implicit understanding that the Membership shall function as the interpretive authority on biblical meaning and application for the purpose of Church doctrine, practice, policy and discipline.

### 10.02 - Statement of Beliefs

We affirm the Holy Bible as the inspired Word of God and the basis of our beliefs. We hold to the historic doctrines of the Baptist faith, including the [Baptist Faith and Message 2000](http://www.sbc.net/bfm2000/bfm2000.asp), which is hereby incorporated by reference, which are briefly summarized and as follows, and the additional beliefs stated within:

#### 10.02.01 - About God and the Trinity

We believe in the one and only true God, Who is spirit, sovereign, personal, infinite and eternal. His is one being of three distinct persons: The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit. We believe that He concerns Himself mercifully in the affairs of men, that He hears and answers prayers, and that He saves from sin and death all who come to Him through Jesus Christ. We believe God is the Creator and Ruler of the world. 

*Genesis 1:1,26,27; Genesis 3:22; Psalm 90:2; Isaiah 45: 5-6, Isaiah 46: 9-10; Matthew 28:19; John 17:3; II Corinthians 13:14; I Peter 1:2*

#### 10.02.02 - About Man

We believe man was created in the image of God and He created them male and female. In the beginning man was innocent of sin and was endowed by His Creator with freedom of choice. By his free choice man sinned against God and brought sin into the human race. As a result, all human beings are born with a sinful nature. Man is incapable of regaining a right relationship with God through his own efforts. It is only the grace of God that can restore man into His holy fellowship and enable man to fulfill the creative purpose of God. 

*Genesis 1:27; Psalm 8:3-6; Isaiah 53:6a, Isaiah 59:1-2; Jeremiah17:9; Romans 3:23, Romans 5:8,12-25; Ephesians 2:1-3*

#### 10.02.03 - About Jesus Christ

We believe in Jesus Christ, God’s only begotten Son, conceived by the Holy Spirit. We believe in His virgin birth, sinless life, miracles, and teachings. We believe in His substitutionary atoning death, bodily resurrection, ascension into Heaven, perpetual intercession for His people, and personal visible return to earth. We believe Jesus Christ is co-equal with the Father and is both fully God and human. It is only through faith in the person and work of Jesus Christ and repentance from sin can one be restored to God and experience true life and joy. He did all this in order to display His love for mankind and to restore them back into a right relationship with Himself. 

*Matthew 1:22-23; Luke 2:52; Colossians 1:15-20; Hebrews 1:1-3; Isaiah 9:6; John 1:1-15, John 14:10-30; Hebrews 4:14-15; I Corinthians 1:15-20; Romans 1:3-4; Acts 1:9-11; I Timothy 6:14-15; Titus 2:13; John 1:29; John 10:1-18; Romans 5:8; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Galatians 1:4; 1 Peter 3:18; Matthew 28:1-20; Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-53; 1 Corinthians 15:12-34; John 14:3; Acts 1:11; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; Hebrews 9:28; 1 John 3:2; Revelation 1:7; John 3:16,18; Acts 4:12; Romans 3:21-26: I Timothy 2:5-6*

#### 10.02.04 - About the Holy Spirit

We believe the Holy Spirit regenerates those who believe and indwells, baptizes, seals, empowers, guides, teaches and sanctifies all who become children of God through Jesus Christ. We believe in the ministry of all the gifts of the Spirit to be functional and an active part of the Church. We believe the Holy Spirit is co-equal with the Father and the Son of God. Through the proclamation of the Gospel, the Holy Spirit reveals to men their need to repent of their sins and confess Jesus as Lord and Savior. He lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation. He provides the Christian with power for living, understanding of spiritual truth, and guidance in doing what is right. He gives every believer a spiritual gift when they are saved. As Christians, we seek to live under His control daily. 

*John 14:16-17; John 16:7-13; Acts 1:8; 1 Corinthians 2:12, 1 Corinthians 3:16; 2 Corinthians 3:17; Galatians 5:25; Ephesians 1:13, 5:18*

#### 10.02.05 - About the devil

We believe in the existence of Satan who was originally created a holy and perfect being, but through pride and unlawful ambition rebelled against God. He is now the prince of the world and leader of all the other fallen angels and evil spirits. He tempted man in the Garden of Eden and Jesus Christ in the wilderness; accuses the saints, is the father of lies and false religions; that he will be destroyed once and for all at the end of the millennial reign and cast into the fires of hell, which have been reserved for him and his angels. 

*Isaiah 14:12-15; Ezekiel 28:14-17; Revelation 12:9; Jude 6; 2 Peter 2:4; Ephesians 2:2; John 14:30; 1 Thessalonians 3:5; Matthew 4:13; 1 Peter 5:8; 1 John 3:8; Matthew 13:25, 37-39; Luke 22:3-4; Revelation 12:10; 2 Corinthians 11:13-15; Mark 13:21-22; I John 4:3; 1 John 2:22; 2 John 7; Revelation 12:7-9; Revelation 20:1-3, 10; Matthew 25:41; 2 Peter 2:4; Jude 1:6*

#### 10.02.06 - About Salvation and Regeneration

We believe that all men are sinners by nature and by choice and are therefore, under condemnation. We believe that the Holy Spirit regenerates those who repent of their sins and trust in Jesus Christ as Savior. We believe salvation is a free gift from God. We believe that the blood Jesus Christ shed on the Cross provides the sole basis for the forgiveness of sin. God offers salvation to those who put their faith in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Chris as sufficient for the payment for their sin. There is no salvation apart from a personal faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior and for the forgiveness of sin. Eternal life begins the moment someone receives Jesus Christ into his or her life by faith. It is only through faith in the person and work of Jesus Christ and repentance from sin that one can be restored to God and experience true life and joy. 

*John 1:12, John 14:6; Romans 5:1, Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5*

#### 10.02.07 - About Eternal Security

We believe God gives the believer eternal life through Jesus Christ, therefore the believer in Jesus is secure in that salvation for eternity. Salvation is maintained by the grace, mercy, and power of God; not by the self-effort of the believer. It is the grace and power of God that gives this security. 

*John 10:29; 2 Timothy 1:12; Hebrews 7:25; Hebrews 10:10, 14; 1 Peter 1:3-5*

#### 10.02.08 - About the Church

We believe in the universal church, a living spiritual body of which Jesus Christ is the head and all regenerated persons are members. We believe in the local church, consisting of a company of believers in Jesus Christ, baptized on a credible profession of faith and associated for worship, work and fellowship. We believe that God has laid upon the members of the local church the primary task of giving the Gospel of Jesus Christ to a lost world. All members of the Church are to be a vital and committed part of the local church. The Church acknowledges Jesus Christ as her only Head and governs herself by democratic principles under the oversight of her membership. Her two ordinances are Baptism by immersion and the Lord’s Supper. 

*Acts 16:5; 1 Corinthians 4:17; Ephesians 5:23; Colossians 1:18*

#### 10.02.09 - Christian Conduct

We believe that a Christian should live for the glory of God and the wellbeing of his/her fellowman: that he/she should strive to live righteously before the world; that he/she should be a faithful steward of his/her possessions; and that he/she should seek to realize for himself/herself and others the stature of maturity in Jesus Christ.

#### 10.02.10 - Ordinances

We believe that our Lord Jesus Christ has committed to ordinances to the local church: baptism and the Lord’s Supper. We believe that Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water into the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. We believe that Christ instituted the Lord’s Supper for commemoration of His death. We believe that these two ordinances should be observed and practiced by all true Believers, until the return of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

*Matthew 3:16; Matthew 28:19-20; Mark 1:9; Acts 2:41; Acts 8:12-13; Acts 8: 38-39; Romans 6:4; 1 Corinthians 11:23-32; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Colossians 2:12; Matthew 26:26-30; Mark 14:22-26; Luke 22:14-20*

#### 10.02.11 - About the Bible

We believe the Bible is God’s Word to us. The Bible was written under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit by human authors. It is the supreme source of truth for Christian beliefs and living. The Scriptures are true, authoritative and sufficient. 

*Psalm 12:6; Psalm 19:7-11; Psalm 119:105; Psalm 138:2; Proverbs 30:5; 2 Timothy 1:13; 1 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21*

#### 10.02.12 - About Religous Liberty and Civil Government

We believe that every human being has direct relations with God, and is responsible to God alone in matters of faith; that the church must be free from interference by any ecclesiastical or political authority; that, therefore, Church and State must be kept separate as having different functions, each fulfilling its duties free from dictation or patronage of the other. We believe that civil government is of divine appointment, for the interests and good order of human society; that magistrates are to be prayed for, conscientiously honored and obeyed; except only in things opposed to the will of our Lord Jesus Christ; who is the Lord of the conscience, and the coming Prince of the Kings of the earth.

*Daniel 3:17-18; Matthew 10:28; Matthew 23:10; Revelation 10:6; Philippians 2:10-11; Psalm 72:11*

#### 10.02.13 - About the Return of Christ

We believe in the second coming of Christ, that His return from Heaven will be personal, visible and glorious, a blessed hope for which we should constantly watch and pray. 

*Matthew 28:6-7; Luke 24:39; John 20:27; 1 Corinthians 15:4; Mark 16:6; Luke 24:2, 4-6; Acts 1:9; Luke 24:51; Mark 16:19; Revelation 3:21; Hebrews 8:1, 6; 1 John 2:1; Hebrews 2:17; Hebrews 5:9-10; John 14:3; Acts 1:11; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; Matthew 24:27, 42; Matthew 25:13; James 5:8; Hebrews 9:28; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17; 1 Corinthians 15:42-44, 51-53; Philippians 3:20-21; Luke 1:32; Isaiah 9:6-7; 1 Corinthians 15:25; Isaiah 11:405; Isaiah 32:1; Psalm 72:8; Revelation 20:1-4, 6; Zechariah 14; Luke 1:32-33; Revelation 3:21; Revelation 19:11-16; Revelation 21:1-6; 2 Peter 3:8-10*

## 10.03 - Statement on Marriage and Sexuality

We believe that the term “marriage” has only one meaning and that is marriage sanctioned by God, which joins one biological, natural-born man and one biological, natural-born woman in a single, exclusive union, as delineated in Scripture. Though various cultures and customs have evolving definitions on marriage, it is God alone who has ultimate authority to prescribe and describe the marital relationship. 

*Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:1-9, Mark 10:1-2*

We believe that God intends sexual intimacy to only occur between a man and a woman who are married to each other. We believe that God has commanded that no intimate sexual activity be engaged in outside of a marriage between a man and a woman.

We believe that any form of sexual immorality, such as adultery, fornication, homosexuality, bisexual conduct, bestiality, incest, pornography or any attempt to change one’s sex, or disagreement with one’s biological, natural-born sex, is sinful and offensive to God. Also, the Church regards as sinful the intent or desire to surgically alter one’s biological, natural-born sex to a different sex. Since the body is a creation of God, the church holds sexual identity to be biologically determined by God at conception, and associated gender norms are to be observed as appropriate to biblical standards. 

*Genesis 1:27; Romans 1:26-32; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11*

So we believe, according to Scripture, that every person must be afforded compassion, love, kindness, respect, and dignity. Hateful and harassing behavior or attitudes directed toward any individual are to be repudiated and are not in accord with Scripture nor the doctrines of the church.

We believe that in order to preserve the function and integrity of the Church as the local Body of Christ, and to provide a biblical role model to the church members and the community, it is imperative that all persons employed by the church in any capacity, or who serve as volunteers, should abide by and agree to the Statement on Marriage and Sexuality and conduct themselves accordingly.

(a) actively participating in the life of the church body.

(b) actively seeking to discover and use their spiritual gifts through a specific ministry of the church.

(c) actively pursuing personal maturity through regular time spent in the Word of God, devotion, and prayer.

(d) actively following the Biblical standard of tithing to financially support the ministries of IBC and those entities supported by IBC around the world.

(e) actively working toward personal maturity and responsibility in their spiritual life and relationships as members of the Body of Christ. Hebrews 5:11-13; Hebrews 10:22-27; Ephesians 4:11-17

Any Member who is not actively involved in the ministries of the church as a member in good standing, as described above, for one (1) year or more without justifiable cause (illness, shut in, unavoidable work conditions, etc.) as defined by the church body, will be removed from the Church’s list of members and ineligible to vote in the business of the Church after biblical attempts for restoration. Active members must be 18 years or older to vote in a business meeting.

### 12.05 - Rights of the Members

Every eligible Member of the Church, who is in good standing and is 18 years old, is entitled to vote at all elections and on all questions submitted to the Members of the Church at regularly or specially called business meetings, provided the member is present or provision has been made for absentee voting. Every Member of the Church, who is in good standing, is eligible for consideration by the membership as a candidate for elected offices in the Church. Every Member of the Church may participate in the ordinances of the Church as administered by the Church. Every Member in good standing may be eligible to teach after being a member for at least six (6) months; they must be nominated by the Nominating Committee.

### 12.06 - Discipline

It shall be the practice of this Church to emphasize to its members that every reasonable measure will be taken to assist any troubled Member. The Pastor, other members of the church staff and others are available for counsel and guidance. The attitude of members toward one another shall be guided by a concern for redemption rather than punishment.

Should some serious condition exist which would cause a member to become an offense and liability to the good name and general welfare of the Church by a reason of immoral and unchristian actions or by persistent breach of his/her covenant vows, the Membership will take every reasonable measure to resolve the problem in accord with

Biblical standards. If it becomes necessary for the Church to take action to revoke a Church Members membership privilege, a vote of the members present is required; and the Church may proceed to declare the person to be no longer in the membership of the Church. The membership of no person shall be terminated (except by letter) at the meeting when the recommendation of such action is made; and all such requests for termination of membership, or the process preceding termination, shall first be considered by the members. A spirit of Christian kindness and forbearance shall pervade all such proceedings.

### 12.07 - Termination of Membership

Membership shall be terminated in the following ways:

(a) death of a member

(b) transfer to another Baptist Church

(c) erasure upon request or proof of membership in a church of another denomination.

(d) upon the written request of the member to be dropped from the roll.

(e) by action of this Church for cause under these By-Laws which include:

(1) unscriptural conduct

(2) departure from the doctrine set forth in the statement of doctrine

(3) being willfully inactive for a period of one (1) year or more

In all cases the Church shall follow the teachings of Matthew 18:15-17; 1 Corinthians 5:1-5; and 2 Thessalonians 3:6-15.

### 12.08 - Limitation of Revocation of Church Membership

Once a Member has had a request for Termination submitted to the Church, the Member may not withdraw their membership from the Church, as they have voluntarily chosen to place themselves under the authority of the Church. It shall be agreed that any member who has had a request for Termination made shall still be a member of the Church, but shall not be in good standing pending any outcome from the Membership

### 12.09 - Restoration of Membership

Dismissed members may be restored to membership by the Church according to the spirit of 2 Corinthians 2:7-8, when their lifestyles are judged to be in accordance with these By-Laws. Restoration of Church membership shall require a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the Membership.

### 12.10 - List of Members

The church clerk shall keep and maintain a complete list of the members and such list shall be on file at the principal office of the church and shall be open to inspection by any member. This list shall constitute the sole and conclusive evidence of who the members are and thus, who may vote in business meetings.

During the visit the Pulpit Committee will interview the candidate in person. After the applicant preaches in two regular services, the Church shall then call a special business meeting at the following Sunday morning worship service and decide to call him as pastor, or to not consider him, and ask the committee to present another candidate. A three-fourth (3/4) majority of the active voting members present at a business meeting called at a regular Sunday morning worship service shall confirm a pastoral call. This call shall be for an indefinite period of time. Much prayer by the Committee and the Membership shall precede the call.

Nominations for the Pulpit Committee will be taken after a Sunday morning or evening worship service as soon as possible after it is known that a new pastor will be needed,

but not later then four weeks after the office becomes vacant. Each church member present at this worship service will be given an opportunity to nominate a person to the Pulpit Committee. If necessary, the Church will prepare a ballot of willing nominees.

If necessary, the election will take place the next Sunday morning after the nominations are made. Election ballots will be handed out to church members after the regular morning worship service. Each member present will then vote for up to five members, with at least one being a Deacon, to sit on the Pulpit Committee. Election ballots will be collected and counted by the Church on the day of the election. The nominees receiving the largest number of votes will comprise the Pulpit Committee.

#### 13.02.03 - Pastoral Contract

## ARTICLE XVI <br/> FISCAL YEAR

### 16.01 - Fiscal Year

The fiscal year of the corporation shall begin on September 1 and shall end of August 31 for each year.

## ARTICLE XVII <br/> ORDINATION AND LICENSING

### 17.01 - Theology

We find no instruction in the New Testament concerning the common practice of ordination, but there are numerous texts that indicate a ‘setting apart’, ‘anointing’, ‘laying on of hands’, and ‘sending out.’ Acts 14:23; 1 Timothy 2:7; Titus 1:5; Acts 6:6; Acts 13:3; 1 Timothy 4:14; and 2 Timothy 1:6

Most, if not all, churches and denominations have a way to publicly recognize and confer authority to those God has entrusted to guide, equip, and lead them. Although the call on a pastor/minister’s life is wrought in the heart and is not contingent upon titles, ordination provides the opportunity for the church to affirm and to recognize this calling

### 17.02 - Definition

In summary, we will use the term “ordination” to mean “to invest with ministerial services, ministry duties or to confer pastoral authority.”

### 17.03 - Practice

Make provision in the Church constitution and By-Laws to provide specific authority to the membership to license and to ordain individuals as ministers of the gospel. The Church determines the qualifications for ordination, and thereby, appoints qualified people. The Church has the authority to also revoke ordination status upon termination of employment or for disciplinary reasons, which would also by default mean a change in the person’s pastoral or ministerial services and roles.

#### 17.03.01 - Housing Allowance

All ordained staff members are eligible for a housing allowing.

#### 17.03.02 - Social Security Coverage

All ordained staff members are permitted to exempt themselves from Social Security coverage if they meet the qualified conditions:

(a) Church ordination.

(b) File Form 4361 with the IRS.

(c) Certify religious opposition to accepting public insurance benefits.

(d) Notify church that they are opposed to Social Security coverage for the services they perform in the exercise of ministry.

(e) IRS verification.

### 17.04 - Ordination Process

Typically, ordination will occur in a meeting of the Church.

### 17.05 - Eligibility

The following pastoral/ministerial positions are eligible for ordination: Pastors, Associate Pastors, and Deacons. Ordination from another church or denomination will not be carried forward to the Church unless approved by the membership.

### 17.06 - Ministerial Licensure Process

The Church does understand that Members (e.g., staff or non-staff) may desire to be licensed in order to provide ministerial services to select populations, perform a wedding, perform a funeral, go on the mission field, etc. Therefore, the Church will consider licensing qualified Members on a case-by-case basis.

In order to be considered for licensure, the following process shall be followed:

(a) The Member shall submit a request to the Pastor.

(b) The request shall include the scope of the ministerial services the candidate desires to perform, along with a basis of reasoning for their performance of said services.

(c) In concert with the Pastor, the request will be considered, discussed and prayed over.

If the Pastor believes the request deserves further merit, then he shall submit the request to the Church as a whole. The Church shall maintain the final level of authority to grant ministerial licensure, and licensure shall be active as long as they are a member in good standing, or unless revoked by the Church. The Clerk of the Church shall maintain a record of the request, along with the respective decision.

### 17.07 - Revocation

Previously issued ministerial licensures may be revoked. The decision to grant or to revoke licensure remains under the sole authority of the Church.

## ARTICLE XVIII <br/> CONFLICT OF INTEREST

### 18.01 - No Appearance of Conflict

Each person who is a Trustee, Officer or Committee member of the Church shall exercise good faith and best efforts in the performance of his or her duties to the Church and all entities affiliated with the Church. In all dealings with and on behalf of the Church or any affiliated entity, each person shall be held to a strict rule of honest and fair dealings with the Church and its affiliated entities and no such person shall use his or her position, or knowledge gained there from, in such a manner as to create a conflict or the appearance of a conflict between the interests of the Church or any affiliated entity and the other interests of such persons.

In all matters affecting the Church or any affiliated entity, each Trustee, Officer, or Committee Member shall not take any position or engage in any act that could adversely affect the Church or any affiliated entity

### 18.02 - Influence

No person who is a Trustee, Officer, or Committee Member of the Church shall accept any material compensation, gift, or other favor that could influence or appear to influence such person’s actions affecting the Church or any affiliated entity. Each Trustee, Officer or Committee Member shall immediately disclose to the Pastor/Chief Executive Officer (see 13.02) of the Church, any employment, activity, investment or other interest which might compete or conflict, appear to compete or conflict, with interests of the Church or any affiliated entity.

### 18.03 - Voting

No Trustee, Officer, Committee Member shall vote, or be counted in determining the quorum for any vote, on any transaction between the Church and any other church, firm, association, or other entity in which such Trustee, Officer or Committee Member has a direct or indirect substantial financial interest. Any such duality of interest shall be disclosed to the other Trustees, Officers, or Committee Members of the Church as applicable and made a matter of record. The Trustee, Officer, or Committee Member shall make such disclosure. In addition to refraining from voting such Trustee, Officer or Committee Member shall not participate in the

deliberations nor use personal influence in the matter, and any such transaction shall be at least as fair and reasonable to the Church as would otherwise then be obtainable by the Church.

For purposes of this section, a Trustee, Officer or Committee Member shall be deemed to have a direct or indirect substantial financial interest in any church, firm, association or other entity in which such person, together such with person’s parents, spouse or all descendants of either of such person’s parents or such person’s spouse have an aggregate, beneficial, or equity interest of one (1) percent or more.

### 18.04 - Determination of Conflict

When in doubt as to whether or not a Conflict of Interest exists or may exist, it shall be the duty of each person to inform the Church Clerk or the Church for clarification.

## ARTICLE XIX <br/> DISPUTE RESOLUTION

### 19.01 - Christian Alternative Dispute Resolution

In keeping with 1 Corinthians 6:1-8, all disputes which may arise (1) between any member of the Church and the Church itself, or (2) between any member of the Church and any Pastor, officer, Trustee, Committee Member, employee, volunteer, agent, or other member of this Church shall be resolved in accordance with the Rules of Procedure for Christian Conciliation, Institute for Christian Conciliation.

#### 19.01.01 - Binding Arbitration

f efforts to conciliate or mediate the dispute fail, then the matter shall be resolved through binding arbitration. The decision of the arbitrators shall be binding on both parties, and both parties submit themselves to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of Arkansas, both state and federal, for the sole purpose of entry of an order from binding arbitration. Each party shall bear their own costs, including attorney’s fees, related to any mediation, conciliation or arbitration proceeding. In no way, and under no circumstances, does the Church agree to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of either the state or federal courts when dealing with matters of an ecclesiastical nature. See Watson v. Jones, 80 U.S. 679, 722 (1871); Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas Cathedral, 344 U.S. 94 (1952); Gonzales v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila, 2801 U.S. (1928). Under Kedroff, no civil court has the authority to resolve “questions of discipline, or of faith, or of ecclesiastical rule custom or law.” Kedroff, 344 U.S. 94.

#### 19.01.02 - Monetary Damages

If a dispute may result in an award of monetary damages, then use of the conciliation, mediation, and arbitration procedure is conditioned on acceptance of the procedure by the liability insurer of the Church and insurer’s agreement to honor any mediation, conciliation or arbitration award up to any applicable policy limits. The mediation, conciliation and arbitration process is not a substitute for any disciplinary process set forth in the By-Laws of the Church and shall in no way affect the authority of the Church to investigate reports of misconduct, conduct hearings, or administer discipline of members.

## ARTICLE XX <br/> EMPLOYEE AND VOLUNTEERS

### 20.01 - Requirements

All employees are required to be Members of the Church and subscribe to the Church’s Statement of Faith as outlined in the By-Laws. All Church workers and volunteers are subject to background checks, and are required to subscribe to the Church’s Statement of Faith and its By-Laws. They must sign a statement annually to abide by these as long as they volunteer. Should the time come when they can no longer abide by these statements, they agree to no longer serve in any capacity at the Church.

## ARTICLE XXI <br/> INDEMINIFICATION

### 21.01 - Indeminification

To the full extent permitted by the Act, as amended from time to time, the Church shall indemnify any Pastor, Trustee, Officer, Committee Member, employee or agent of the Church who was, is, or may be named a defendant or respondent to any proceeding as a result of his or her actions or omissions within the scope of his or her official capacity in the Church. Legal counsel selected by the majority vote of the Membership shall make a determination of the right of indemnification under the Act.

### 21.02 - Limitations

No indemnification or advance shall be made under this ARTICLE in any circumstances when it appears:

(a) That the indemnification or advance would be inconsistent with a provision of the ARTICLEs of Incorporation, the By-Laws, resolution of the members, or an agreement in effect at the time of accrual of the alleged cause of action asserted in the proceedings in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits of otherwise indemnification; or

(b) That the indemnification would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in approving settlement.
